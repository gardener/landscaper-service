# ServiceTargetConfigs

ServiceTargetConfigs are kubernetes resources that represent a target cluster on which a Landscaper as a service can be deployed.
Each ServiceTargetConfig has a reference to a Secret that contains the Kubeconfig of the target cluster.
ServiceTargetConfigs doesn't need to reside in the namespaces as [LandscaperDeployments](LandscaperDeployments.md) and [Instances](Instances.md) which are referencing it.
It is advised to create the ServiceTargetConfigs in a separate namespace that is only accessible by administrators.

### Basic structure:

````yaml
apiVersion: landscaper-service.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceTargetConfig

metadata:
  name: default
  labels:
    config.landscaper-service.gardener.cloud/visible: "true"
    config.landscaper-service.gardener.cloud/region: "eu-west-1"

spec:
  providerType: gcp | aws | alicloud
  priority: 10

  secretRef:
    name: default-target
    namespace: laas-system
    key: kubeconfig

status:
  instanceRefs:
    - name: test
      namespace: my-namespace
````

## Labels

ServiceTargetConfigs support two special labels:

* `config.landscaper-service.gardener.cloud/visible` defines the visibility of the ServiceTargetConfig. 
When set to `true`, the ServiceTargetConfig can be used to schedule new deployments of the Landscaper on the referenced kubernetes cluster.
When not set or set to any other value than `true`, no new deployments can be scheduled on the referenced cluster.
* `config.landscaper-service.gardener.cloud/region` can be used to specify the geo-region of the referenced kubernetes cluster.
LandscaperDeployments can make use of this label to specify on which geo-region the Landscaper shall be deployed.


## Provider Type

The field `spec.providerType` specifies the infrastructure provider of the referenced kubernetes cluster.
Currently, supported values are:

* `gcp`
* `aws`
* `alicloud`


## Priority

The `spec.priority` field is an integer number specifying the scheduling priority for the ServiceTargetConfig. 
ServiceTargetConfigs with a higher priority number will be prioritized over those ServiceTargetConfigs with a lower priority.
If the priority of two ServiceTarget configs is the same, the one with the lower number of Instances references will be prioritized.


## Secret Reference

The `spec.secretRef` field references a kubernetes secret by a name, a namespace and the key within the secret.
The key must contain the kubeconfig for the kubernetes target cluster on which Landscaper deployments are scheduled.


## Instance References

The `status.instanceRefs` is a list containing references to all Instances using this ServiceTargetConfig.
