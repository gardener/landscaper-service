# LandscaperDeployments

LandscaperDeployments are kubernetes resources that represent a deployment of a landscaper instance.
The landscaper service controller will select a suitable [ServiceTargetConfig](ServiceTargetConfigs.md) and create an [Instance](Instances.md) for the LandscaperDeployment.

### Basic structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: landscaper-service.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: LandscaperDeployment
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  purpose: "test"
  region: "eu-west-1"
  landscaperConfiguration:
    deployers:
      - helm
      - manifest
      - container
  componentReference:
    context: mycontext
    componentName: github.com/gardener/landscaper/landscaper-service
    version: v0.16.0

status:
  instanceRef:
    name: test
    namespace: my-namespace
```

## Purpose

The `spec.purpose` field should contain the human-readable purpose of the LandscaperDeployment. 


## Region

The `spec.region` field is optional and can be used to restrict the selected target kubernetes cluster to a specific geo-region.


## Landscaper Configuration

The `spec.landscaperConfiguration` field contains the configuration of the Landscaper deployment.
Configuration contains the list of the standard deployers that shall be deployed.
For available deployers please check [this documentation](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper/tree/master/docs/deployer).

## Component Reference

The `spec.componentReference` field contains the following configuration:

* `context`: _Optional_; Specifies the [Landscaper context](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper/blob/master/docs/usage/Context.md) to use for the Installation. 
   When not specified, defaults to the `default` context.
* `componentName`: _Optional_; Specifies the component name of the Landscaper Service deployment to use. Default: `github.com/gardener/landscaper/landscaper-service`
* `version`: _Required_; Specifies the version of the Landscaper that shall be deployed. Changing this value will attempt to upgrade/downgrade the existing Landscaper deployment.

## Instance Reference

The `status.instanceRef` field will be set by the landscaper service controller when the Instance for the LandscaperDeployment has been created.
